## Description

The Landing Page Project is a simple web page that serves as a template for creating landing pages. It consists of an index.html file, an app.js file, and a styles.css file. The project aims to demonstrate dynamic navigation bar creation, smooth scrolling to sections, and section highlighting based on scroll position.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: This file contains the structure of the landing page. It consists of a header with a navigation bar, four sections in the body, and a footer.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for dynamically building the navigation bar as an unordered list. It also enables smooth scrolling to the appropriate section in the body when an item from the navigation menu is clicked. Additionally, it implements section highlighting based on scroll position.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that contains the styling rules for elements in the `index.html` file.

## How to Run

To run the Landing Page Project, follow these steps:

1. Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
4. Explore the landing page and interact with the navigation menu to see the smooth scrolling and section highlighting in action.
